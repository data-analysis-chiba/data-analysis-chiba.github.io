[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a GitHub repo that provides one dataset per week to practice learning data science skills.

For the final project, you will choose one dataset from TidyTuesday and use it to make at least two plots.

This will show you **how to find and load a dataset from TidyTuesday**.

## Choose a dataset

In your browser, navigate to <https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday>

![TidyTuesday repo](../images/tidytues-top.png)

Scroll down until you reach the section labeled ["DataSets"](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#datasets).

!["DataSets" section](../images/tidytues-datasets.png)

Once you find a dataset that sounds interesting, click on its link in the "Data" column.

For example, I think "The History of Himalayan Mountaineering Expeditions" dataset sounds interesting, so I'll [click on that](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/readme.md).

!["DataSets" section](../images/tidytues-datasets-himalaya.png)

This will take us to the README file (a file that explains basic info about a piece of software, dataset, or analysis) for the "History of Himalayan Mountaineering Expeditions" dataset.

The [first few paragraphs](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/readme.md#the-history-of-himalayan-mountaineering-expeditions) give you an overview of the dataset.

## Load the data

The section called of the README file called "[The Data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/readme.md#the-data)" tells you **how to load the data into R**.

!["The Data" section shows how to load the dataset](../images/tidytues-himalaya-data.png)

**This is very important**, because you need to load the data to analyze it.

Note that there are usually **two** options given for loading the data.

You only need to use one of them; [option 2](#option-2) is probably easier.

### Option 1

The first option involves installing the "tidytuesdayR" package, which you can do with the command `install.packages("tidytuesdayR")`.

Once you've installed the package, you can use it to load the data by specifying the date the data were published on TidyTuesday.

```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)

tuesdata <- tt_load("2025-01-21")
```

Note that the TidyTuesday webpage shows `tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2025-01-21")`, but this does the same thing as running `library(tidytuesdayR)` followed by `tt_load("2025-01-21")`.

Also, when you use Option 1, the data are loaded as a list, so we need to extract each dataframe from the list. For the himalaya data, there are two dataframes. It shows us how to extract them from the list using the `$` symbol:

```{r}
exped_tidy <- tuesdata$exped_tidy
peaks_tidy <- tuesdata$peaks_tidy
```

### Option 2

The second option is simpler. You can use the `read_csv()` function to load the data directly without installing another package.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)

exped_tidy <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/exped_tidy.csv"
)
peaks_tidy <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/peaks_tidy.csv"
)
```

## Take a look at the data

Now that you've loaded the data, have a look at it:

```{r}
exped_tidy
```

```{r}
peaks_tidy
```

Note that since there are **two dataframes** in this dataset, you may need to [join them](../day5/index.qmd) in order to conduct the data analysis.

## Check the Data Dictionary

Every dataset in TidyTuesday includes a "Data Dictionary" that explains what each column in the data means.
Scroll down the README file a bit further to [find it](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/readme.md#data-dictionary).
This is very important for understanding and analyzing your data.

## Start exploring the data!

For example, let's count the names of the mountain peaks included in the `peaks_tidy` data:

```{r}
peaks_tidy |>
  count(PKNAME)
```

Once you get a feel for the columns in the dataset, try [making some plots](../day6/index.qmd).

Your goal is to create a plot that tells the story hidden in the data. Good luck!
